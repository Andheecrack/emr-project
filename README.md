# AI-Enhanced EMR Security

Welcome to the AI-Enhanced EMR Security project! This repository contains the code and documentation for integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems to enhance security. Our aim is to leverage AI technologies to protect sensitive medical data from unauthorized access and potential security threats.

## Introduction

Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems are essential for modern healthcare, but they are also prime targets for cyberattacks. Traditional security measures are no longer sufficient to protect against sophisticated threats. This project aims to integrate AI-based solutions to enhance the security of EMR systems, providing real-time threat detection, anomaly detection, and automated responses to potential breaches.

## Features

- **Real-Time Threat Detection**: Utilize machine learning algorithms to monitor and identify potential security threats in real time.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Detect unusual patterns of access or data usage that may indicate a security breach.
- **Automated Response**: Automatically respond to detected threats with predefined actions, such as alerting administrators or isolating affected systems.
- **Audit Logging**: Maintain detailed logs of all activities for auditing and compliance purposes.
- **Data Encryption**: Ensure all data is encrypted both in transit and at rest to protect against unauthorized access.

## Installation

To install and set up the AI-Enhanced EMR Security project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-emr-security.git
    cd ai-emr-security
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the necessary configuration variables (see Configuration section).

4. **Initialize the database**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, it will start monitoring the EMR system for security threats. The following components are included:

- **Dashboard**: A web-based interface for viewing security alerts and system status.
- **API**: RESTful API for integrating with other systems and applications.
- **Agent**: A lightweight agent that can be installed on EMR systems to send data to the central AI engine for analysis.

## Configuration

The application requires certain environment variables to be set for proper operation. These can be added to the `.env` file:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
AI_MODEL_PATH=path_to_ai_model
EMAIL_HOST=email_host
EMAIL_PORT=email_port
EMAIL_USE_TLS=True_or_False
EMAIL_HOST_USER=email_host_user
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=email_host_password
```
